By the time you unbox that shiny new gadget or install that new software update, it's time to move onto the next big thing.\n\nThe scope of technology stretched far beyond smartphones and laptops this year. Sure, we saw Android smartphones mature and catch up to the iPhone with premium materials and powerful cameras, but we also got \"hoverboards,\" and more affordable drones, and our first real taste of consumer VR. Wearables, particularly, smartwatches, are also finally becoming mainstream with fashionable styles and intuitive use cases.\n\nThe very best of these products were awarded Mashable Choice. These products excelled within their product categories and delivered on value, quality and function.\n\nHere are Mashable's picks for the most outstanding tech products of the year.\n\n1. Amazon Echo\n\nThe Amazon Echo is part Bluetooth speaker, part personal voice assistant, and 100% awesome. The $179.99 tube is controlled entirely with your voice and understands commands to play music, tell you the weather and read headlines. The biggest reason to buy the Amazon is how it easily integrates with existing smart home devices from Philips' Hue Lights to Samsung's SmartThings. Connecting supported third-party smart home gadgets is super easy and using Alexa, the voice assistant, to switch them on and off is so responsive and intuitive, you wonder how Amazon figured out the smart home before Apple and Google did.\n\n2. Microsoft Surface Book\n\nThe Surface Book is a not exactly a laptop. It's an evolutionary convergence of tablet and ultra-portable design innovation. Made from magnesium, the Surface Book is both solid and sturdy. Press a button on the keyboard and the screen detaches to become its own turbo-charged tablet. The screen is brilliant, Windows 10 is smooth and the pen input is significantly more accurate than other styli. With Surface Book, Microsoft\u2019s taken every lesson it\u2019s learned from years of watching others build Windows laptops and done them all one better.\n\n3. iPad Pro\n\nThe iPad Pro is the biggest iPad ever and a clear nod to Microsoft's Surface Pro devices. When paired with the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil, the iPad Pro transforms into a powerful productivity workhorse. The iPad Pro is so powerful, it can edit three 4K video streams simultaneously in iMovie. Apple's giant tablet isn't for everyone, but for those who need to get \"real work\" done, the iPad Pro is up for the task.\n\n4. Volvo V60 Polestar\n\nPolestar's tuned Volvo V60 might not be better than its competition, but it's the most fun Volvo sports wagon to-date. Then Polestar bolts on bigger wheels, bigger brakes, suspension that is 80% stiffer than stock, and a 2.5-inch stainless steel full-flow exhaust system with twin 3.5-inch tail pipes. The result is a car that accelerates like a Mercedes-AMG, brakes like a BMW, spits and crackles like a Jaguar F-Type, but looks like a safe family hauler. If you're going to consider the V60 Polestar, realize you're going to have to suffer the ridiculous looks of strangers and a suspension that feels like it's not quite yet sorted.\n\n5. iPhone 6S/iPhone 6S Plus\n\nThe iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are evolutionary \u2014 as opposed to revolutionary \u2014 updates to the last year's iPhone 6 and 6S Plus. Usually, an \"S\" model year is modest with faster hardware under the hood, but the 6S and 6S Plus are more than just that. Apple added 3D touch, boosted the cameras to 12-megapixels on the back and 5-megapixels on the front, added 4K video recording, a Touch ID sensor that's twice as fast, and a stronger metal body. Most important of all: It comes in rose gold. Every iPhone is the best iPhone ever and the 6S is no different.\n\n6. Swagway\n\nWalking is lame. At least, that's what \"hoverboard\" makers like Swagway want you to believe. Why walk when you can roll down the street like a boss from the future? Hoverboards like the Swagway X1 put personal mobility vehicles on the map this year in a huge way. At the same time, they also stirred up controversy after several of them exploded over the holidays, airlines banned them, and certain cities declare them not street-legal. The Swagway X1 goes for $400, which is on the low-end, but hoverboards can be found north of $1,500.\n\n7. Samsung Gear S2\n\nMost round-shaped smartwatches are duds because they're essentially running software designed for rectangular displays. Samsung's Gear S2, however, is thoughtfully designed with purpose and speed. To navigate around the Tizen-based OS, you simply rotate the bezel. Also, unlike Samsung's million previous smartwatches, the Gear S2 is extremely comfortable to wear. The $299.99 price tag also makes it cheaper than the cheapest Apple Watch. There's also a classic model that's more suited for dress shirts and blazers if the S2's sporty design isn't your cup of tea.\n\n8. New Apple TV\n\nThe box may not look too different, but Apple completely overhauled the experience on the new Apple TV. No longer a hobby, the new Apple TV runs tvOS and opens the doors for apps of all kinds to proliferate. In addition to the brand new interface and universal search, Apple redesigned the remote control with a glass touchpad and Siri voice controls. $149 for a 32GB model gets you through the door and $169 boosts you up to 64GB.\n\n9. Windows 10\n\nWith Windows 10, Microsoft listened to its users. Windows 10 brought back the desktop as the front-facing interface and restored the Start menu. Microsoft's latest operating system also brought Cortana, the built-in assistant from its mobile devices, and a brand new lighter and faster web browser called Microsoft Edge. Other features like Continuum crunches the OS into a touch-friendly interface. Best of all, Microsoft is making Windows 10 free for all Window 7/8/8.1 users for the first year.\n\n10. Google Nexus 6P\n\nAfter last year's too-damn-big Nexus 6, Google came to its senses and released the more reasonably-sized Nexus 6P. Built by Huawei, the Nexus 6P packs in all of latest and greatest smartphone specs (including a lightning quick fingerprint sensor) in an all-metal body that feels great in the hand. The QuadHD screen is stunning, battery life is all-day, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow without any bloatware is a godsend. And for the first time, the Nexus 6P's cameras don't suck. The fact  Google's selling it for only $499 unlocked is like icing on a cake.\n\n11. Polaroid Snap\n\nThe Polaroid Snap digital instant camera is Polaroid's most exciting product in years. The $99.99 digital camera may look like a toy, but there's no denying the photo stickers it prints out with its built-in ZINK printer are charming. At a time when you can take as many digital photos as your memory card can store, it's nice to be able to touch and hold your photos.\n\n12. Samsung Portable SSD T1\n\nSamsung's Portable SSD T1 ticks both the security and speed checkboxes, and does so in a package that's smaller than a standard business card. The T1 offers AES 256-bit hardware encryption (NSA-level protection) and is so fast it can move a 3GB file from a computer to it in eight seconds over USB 3.0. We moved a 15GB 4K movie from a MacBook Air to the T1 in 37 seconds; in comparison, a regular hard drive took 3 minutes. The price for all that speed doesn't come cheap: $500 (although you can find it for as low as $376 on Amazon and other online retails).\n\n13. Sphero BB-8\n\nDisney and its toy partners are milking the Star Wars franchise for all its worth, but none is perhaps more adorable than the $149.99 Sphero BB-8. The little ball 'bot works just like in The Force Awakens and rolls around at a speedy pace when paired to an iOS or Android device. The new cutest droid in the entire galaxy succeeds because it's more than a toy. It's a digital companion that will entertain Star Wars-loving fans of all ages.\n\n14. Apple Watch\n\nAfter years of rumors, Apple finally launched the Apple Watch, its take on a smartwatch. The Apple Watch has its fair share of issues -- it can be slow and confusing to operate at first -- but it's without a doubt the most fashionable smartwatch out there. Available in two sizes and a dizzying array of band styles, the Apple Watch offers something for everyone at all price points, starting from $249 all the way up to $17,000.\n\n15. DJI Phantom 3 Standard\n\nThe DJI Phantom 3 Standard is not the most decked-out drone you can buy, nor is it an underpowered one that will snap in half, either. For $699, the Phantom 3 Standard is a reasonably-priced consumer drone that has all the earmarks and performance of a pro unit. It's easy to set up, has an amazing HD camera and flying it is straightforward.\n\n16. New MacBook\n\nAt 2 pounds and a little over over half an inch thick, the new MacBook gives new meaning to thin and light laptops. The 12-inch Retina display is to die for and battery life is solid at 9 hours of web browsing. The two polarizing changes are its single USB-C port and redesigned keyboard, which uses a \"butterfly mechanism\" and has less key travel. At $1,299, the new MacBook is a bit on the pricey side, but make no mistake, this is what the every laptop will look like in a few years.\n\n17. Samsung Gear VR\n\nMost VR headsets from the Oculus Rift to PlayStation VR aren't slated to become commercially available until next year. If you want VR now, the simplest and cheapest entry-point is with Samsung's third-gen Gear VR. The $99 headset is not only extremely affordable, but improves on many of the issues that plagued the first and second version. It's lighter comfier, and supports four phones (Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge+). \n\n18. LG G4\n\nLG didn't follow the bandwagon with a metal phone. Instead, its G4 double downed on features its competitors were dropping. Removable battery? Check. MicroSD card slot? Check. The G4's best feature, however, is its 16-megapixel camera; thanks to the f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization, the camera is unequivocally the greatest when it comes to low-light performance. The camera even has a manual mode and can shoot in RAW, features normally reserved for professional cameras.\n\n19. Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 is arguably one of the best Android phones of the year. Samsung finally ditched the plastic for metal and glass and the result was a gorgeous, ultra-thin, premium-feeling phone with an equally spectacular QuadHD-resolution display. A ridiculously fast 16-megapixel camera and fast wireless charging round out Samsung's flagship smartphone.\n\n20. Dell XPS 13\n\nDell's XPS 13 is an absolute stunner of an ultraportable laptop. Somehow, Dell managed to squeeze in a 13-inch screen into a chassis that's fit for a 12-inch laptop. With a beautiful display, great performance and big battery life, the XPS 13 set the bar really high for other Windows laptops. Though there are a bunch of models to pick from, the $999 model definitely hits the sweet spot of price for the whole package."},"shares":{"facebook":101,"linked_in":40,"twitter":1002,"google_plus":12,"total":1155},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIxLzdkL0Jlc3RUZWNoLmRiZmYwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/e5f7dd02/eac/Best-Tech.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIxLzdkL0Jlc3RUZWNoLmRiZmYwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/9e8a7dd8/eac/Best-Tech.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIxLzdkL0Jlc3RUZWNoLmRiZmYwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/04f2bfba/eac/Best-Tech.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIxLzdkL0Jlc3RUZWNoLmRiZmYwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/e97b9a2e/eac/Best-Tech.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIxLzdkL0Jlc3RUZWNoLmRiZmYwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/273b010b/eac/Best-Tech.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIxLzdkL0Jlc3RUZWNoLmRiZmYwLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/d95af7b9/eac/Best-Tech.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1PbMFxt","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"These ones are worth every penny.","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"5677337697b2f8691f0017fc","id":"2015/12/20/biggest-news-of-2015","title":"The stories that defined 2015","title_tag":null,"author":"Amanda Wills","post_date":"2015-12-20T23:01:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 23:01:52 +0000","sort_key":"1AaMZa","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/12/20/biggest-news-of-2015/","content":{"plain":"From the Paris attacks, to the historic climate deal, to Star Wars, these were the biggest news events of the year."},"shares":{"facebook":129,"linked_in":21,"twitter":1079,"google_plus":5,"total":1234},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2UzL2NoYXJsaWVoZWJkLjc2ODhjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/4c8946ef/d0c/charliehebdo1.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2UzL2NoYXJsaWVoZWJkLjc2ODhjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/978674cc/d0c/charliehebdo1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2UzL2NoYXJsaWVoZWJkLjc2ODhjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/d3a1e542/d0c/charliehebdo1.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2UzL2NoYXJsaWVoZWJkLjc2ODhjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/07368a2e/d0c/charliehebdo1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2UzL2NoYXJsaWVoZWJkLjc2ODhjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/43598110/d0c/charliehebdo1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2UzL2NoYXJsaWVoZWJkLjc2ODhjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/fa65efa8/d0c/charliehebdo1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1YuhNe0","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"From the Paris attacks, to the historic climate deal, to Star Wars, these were the biggest news events of the year.

Kids all around the world send letters addressed to Santa at the North Pole to ask for presents in exchange for good behavior. \n\nThe letters couldn\u2019t just go to Santa -- they had to be mailed to the North Pole: Santa\u2019s headquarters. Filled with Arctic chill, hardworking elves, red-nosed reindeer and Santa\u2019s workshop, the North Pole is a magical place.\n\nBut how did the myth of the North Pole come to be? How did Santa\u2019s ground zero become the North Pole?\n\nLet\u2019s start with Santa.\n\nSaint Nick didn\u2019t begin as the plump, jolly, white-bearded man we all know today. \r\n \n\nThe origins of Santa Claus can be traced back to Saint Nicholas of Myra, a fourth-century saint who lived not in the North Pole, but in a Roman town now in Turkey.\n\nSaint Nicholas had strong beliefs in the principles of Christianity and an affinity for giving gifts. His generosity made him famous -- especially among sailors during the height of Saint Nicholas\u2019s giving. Sailors spread the story of Saint Nicholas\u2019s generosity throughout the world and gave hope to those in need.\n\nSanta\u2019s move from Turkey to the Arctic is credited to the German-born American cartoonist Thomas Nast. Nast submitted a total of 33 drawings depicting Christmas to Harper\u2019s Weekly from 1863 to 1886. Though many artists drew Saint Nicholas, in the December 1866 issue of Harper\u2019s Weekly, Nast created the beginnings of a more robust and jolly version of Santa.\n\nBefore Nast\u2019s design, Santa was shown in many different forms. But he changed the way we saw St. Nick forever: He gave us Santa\u2019s workshop and the large book of naughty and nice children to watch over. (You can credit Nast for your child\u2019s change in behavior during the month of December.)\n\nEven more, he gave his new mythical Santa a home. Nast\u2019s illustration of the North Pole is part of the legend we all know today. Children adored his images and kept up the fantasies.\n\nBut why the North Pole?\n\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s there were several expeditions to the Arctic, which gained worldwide media attention.\n\nThe Arctic had become a famous and fabled location. A location where it snowed all year round and could be understood as a respite for a creature that is always associated with the cold. Snow had become a universal symbol of Christmas cheer and to Nast and his followers it only made sense for Santa to live with Christmas cheer every day of the year.\n\nNast\u2019s publications celebrated the idea that the North Pole was still an untouched story. The North Pole was just as much of a fantasy as Saint Nicholas, as no one would claim to have conquered the journey to the Pole until 1909, when Robert Peary received the honor.\n\nNo one knew what the North Pole contained, so why couldn\u2019t Santa and his reindeer be hiding at the top of the world?\n\nThough Nast did give us much of Santa\u2019s jolly behavior, Santa\u2019s reindeer had already been a part of the tale, thanks to Clement C. Moore\u2019s 1983 poem, \"A Visit from Saint Nicholas\" or what we know today as, \u201cThe Night Before Christmas.\u201d It was easy enough for Nast to make the leap that reindeer, which live in cold places like Finland, could survive in the frozen terrain of the Arctic. \n\nThe American story of Santa Claus is deeply rooted in our history: Our connection to the North Pole is based on what information we knew about the world at the time. \n\nThough we now know exactly what lies at the North Pole and that its biggest claim to fame is it\u2019s the most northern point on the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, we continue to tell our children, nieces and nephews to write and send their letters to the far North."},"shares":{"facebook":84,"twitter":669,"linked_in":10,"google_plus":4,"total":767},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2NiL2xldHRlcnNfbm9yLmNlZjVhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/d99c382d/1b0/letters_north_pole_santa.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2NiL2xldHRlcnNfbm9yLmNlZjVhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/1b27d19e/1b0/letters_north_pole_santa.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2NiL2xldHRlcnNfbm9yLmNlZjVhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/a5880a33/1b0/letters_north_pole_santa.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2NiL2xldHRlcnNfbm9yLmNlZjVhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/572ad3ea/1b0/letters_north_pole_santa.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2NiL2xldHRlcnNfbm9yLmNlZjVhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/b8c680b5/1b0/letters_north_pole_santa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2NiL2xldHRlcnNfbm9yLmNlZjVhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/ce264e08/1b0/letters_north_pole_santa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1QB9Rqs","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Why the North Pole?","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Lifestyle","channel_label":"Travel","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/travel/"},{"_id":"567722ffb05f9d3d8a001193","id":"2015/12/20/refugee-kids-fugees","title":"Teens talk about the hardest part of being a refugee","title_tag":null,"author":"Aubrey Aden-Buie","post_date":"2015-12-20T21:51:44+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 21:51:44 +0000","sort_key":"1AaLTi","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/12/20/refugee-kids-fugees/","content":{"plain":"A group of young adults from The Fugees Academy, a school for low-income refugee children just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, speak about what they imagined the United States would be like before they moved, what their lives are like now, and some of the struggles of life as a refugee.

Ted Cruz is the obvious choice for president.\n\n\"He is a Christian conservative and this is what we want,\" Whitecotton, a retired insurance agent told Mashable before a recent Cruz rally. Donald Trump, she added, \"doesn't want to observe Christian principles, biblical principles. Ted Cruz is the only one.\"\n\nWhitecotton and her husband were among the hundreds of people who'd come out to rally for the Texas senator at Life Church, a Pentecostal congregation in Mechanicsville, Virginia, a town just north of Richmond built around acres of Civil War battlefields. \n\nTheir comments illustrate why Cruz has been propelled to second place in national primary polls, and highlight why the front-running Trump has seen his numbers fall in Iowa: Cruz is winning over Christian conservatives.\n\nAnd that could be what propels Cruz to a primary victory next year, as that segment of the GOP is one of the best at grassroots organizing \u2014 a crucial part of every campaign that Trump's campaign may not possess.\n\nThe Evangelical vote\n\nNearly two thirds of the delegates from primary contests taking place before March 8 come from states where Evangelicals account for at least half of the electorate, according to a study from the University of Virginia Center for Politics.  \n\nSee also: Ted Cruz fires another shot at Marco Rubio in battle over immigration\n\nAnd that fact isn't lost on the Cruz campaign, which has made winning the Evangelical vote a cornerstone of their primary strategy.\n\nBefore his speech, Cruz brought up the need to bring more Evangelicals to the polls in 2016. And during his speech, in which he spoke with the cadence of a preacher, rising up his voice at the end of sentences to excite the crowd, he brought up issues that played well with the Christian conservative base.\n\nHe said he'll end the \"persecution of religious liberty.\" He'll move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \"the once and eternal capital of Israel,\" a big issue among religious Republicans. And he'll open up an investigation into Planned Parenthood \u2014 a group derided by the anti-abortion crowd and a line which got one of the loudest applauses of the day.\n\n\u201cFifty-four million evangelicals stayed home in the last election cycle. If just 10 million of them had come out and vote, we would have had President Romney,\" Chris Shores, a member of Cruz\u2019s Virginia leadership team, told Mashable. \"So part of the strategy of this campaign is to reach out to the base of our party, to the grassroots of our party.\u201d\n\nCruz's Virginia rally took place on the second day of a week-long swing he embarked on through seven Super Tuesday states where Evangelical voters could have an outsized impact on the GOP nominee. The \"Take Off With Ted\" tour's itinerary included Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee Arkansas and Oklahoma \u2014 states where Evangelicals make up more than 70% of the Republican primary electorate, according to the Center for Politics.\n\nAll of the rallies are Christmas themed, and like Friday's event in Virginia, would include a Santa Claus impersonator who sat for pictures with young attendees.\n\n\"The church has always been a part of shaping our government,\" Life Church's Senior Pastor Buddy Thompson told the audience before Cruz spoke, eliciting raucous applause and a standing ovation from many in the crowd. \n\n\"It started in the church, let's keep it in the church,\" Thompson added.\n\n.@TedCruz and Santa Claus.

Especially as Carson's star fades in the race after his blunders on foreign policy. \n\nThey include Bob Vander Plaats, a prominent Christian conservative leader in Iowa, and James Dobson, the Evangelical leader and founder of Focus on the Family, a Christian conservative group that opposes social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. \n\n.@TedCruz just picked up the endorsement of Dr. James Dobson, the latest prominent social conservative to line up behind the Texas senator.\u2014 Teddy Davis (@TeddyDavisCNN) December 17, 2015\n\nVander Plaats told Mashable that voters on the Christian Right are the most organized and one of the most dedicated voting blocs in the GOP, and said if Cruz wins them over, he'll be hard to beat for the nomination.\n\n\"When we held our forum on Nov. 20, we had a winter storm warning and no one should've been out on the roads,\" Vander Plaats said, referring to a snow storm in Des Moines, Iowa, that dumped more than 10 inches of snow on the ground. \"No one should've been out on the roads, and 1,500 people showed up on our door. When you get homeschool groups or people of faith or pro family groups, they are natural organizers.\"\n\nAttendees at Cruz's Friday Virginia rally agreed. \n\nBert Ray, senior pastor at Abundant Life Pentecostal Church in Virginia and a Cruz supporter, told Mashable before the Virginia rally that while he doesn't specifically counsel his congregation to vote for a specific candidate, he thinks Cruz's moral character will draw Christian voters his way. \n\n\u201cIt'll probably be a great victory for him to be supported by the churches,\" Ray said.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

A report from Nielson found that 55% of online consumers are willing to pay more for products from brands that showcase a positive environmental or social impact. \n\nSee also: The 10 most cringeworthy advertising fails of 2015\n\nMillennials in particular have proven more idealistic and socially active than cohorts before them, and they tend to shop at companies that share their worldview. Now that they increasingly dominate the marketplace, advertisers are more than happy to oblige them.\n\nSpurred in part by the success of corporations like Dove, Nike and REI that project an image of social awareness, the advertising industry is now burrowing these services into their larger operations.  \n\nA cottage industry of ad shops devoted entirely to social good has sprouted up to serve this new demand and even major agencies like Los Angeles-based 72andSunny have launched internal teams with this sole purpose. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, the increasingly competitive market for social cause advertising brings with it an heightened sense of skepticism. In order to be believable, social causes have to be directly tied to a brand's image, and the company needs to convince consumers of its commitment. \n\n\"The shift now is that it's less about getting credit for the good and making veneer-deep associations with a cause and more about doing fewer, deeper things that resonate with your customers more,\" said Jim Moriarty, who heads up 72andSunny's brand citizenship team. \"You can only tap-dance for so long.\"\n\nMillennials are said to be particularly attuned to false sincerity in advertising. Brands that latch on to the hot social issue of the moment without a concrete business end risk coming off as opportunistic -- which was part of the reason Starbucks' \"Race Together\"campaign bellyflopped this year. \n\nThe ones that make the best use of social causes are able to make the case that the issue they are pushing also serves their own best interests in a distinct way, such as campaigns like Google's \"Girls Who Code.\"\n\n\"It's the most authentic when it comes from the soul of a brand,\" says Joe Corr, a principal at social good-focused agency School. \"Purpose is not something that's temporary -- it's something that should be a permanent part of the brand.\"\n\nThat's not to say that every well-executed do-good campaign immediately translates into a tangible action. Advertisers still often fail to galvanize initial social media buzz into a bigger concerted push and thus squander powerful oppportunities, says Trisha Blake, managing partner at social good-focused Civilian Agency.\n\n\"With everybody jumping on the bandwagon, it to some degree convolutes it because it goes straight to what we need is social media activation,\" Blake said. \"Which is great but what comes after the activation?\" \n\nHere are some of the social causes that advertisers congregated around this year, and a few where they fell short. \r\n \r\nHITS:\n\n1. Same-sex sameness\n\nAdvertisers have been breaking more and more ground towards genuinely portraying gay and lesbian people in recent years. In 2015, it seemed that brands were finally comfortable enough with it to start mapping out prosaic everyday life in a diverse array of same-sex households.\n\nA slew of major brands -- including Campbell\u2019s Soup, Wells Fargo, Honey Maid, Hallmark, Ikea, Kohl\u2019s and Tylenol -- featured gay or lesbian couples in their ads, often caring for their children in a family setting without too much fanfare. \n\nCommercials like these have helped more tightly weave the LGBT experience into the fabric of American mainstream culture, said Joe Landry, who publishes LGBT-oriented media such as The Advocate and Out magazine.\n\n\"2015 was the year of Love and Family in LGBT advertising campaigns,\" Landry said in an email. \"We can now be portrayed as the loving, family and relationship-oriented folks that most of us are.\" \n\nMore Americans than ever are now in favor of same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court's legalization of it made 2015 a watershed year for LGBT rights. Dozens of brands cheered the Supreme Court's decision on Twitter and Facebook with light-hearted and poignant tributes.    \n\nEven before that, a host of major companies, including progressive tech leaders and even such heartland staples as Walmart and Nascar, lashed out at Indiana and Arkansas when the states tried to pass laws that would've opened the door for businesses to discriminate against the LGBT community, . \n\nDefinitively gone are the days of \"gay vague\" advertising, when brands would try to discreetly hint at gay and lesbian issues without drawing the attention of the larger public.\n\n2. Girl power\n\nStrong women and girls made for some of the best commercials in 2015 -- from the wave of sentimental ads that celebrated Serena Williams' tennis dominance to Procter and Gamble's powerful sequel campaign to \"Like a Girl\" to Ronda Rousey flipping the script on Carl's Jr.'s usual sexism. \n\nIt seems that advertisers, for the most part, have elected to do away with some of the stale advertising tropes that have long reinforced cultural gender norms. In addition to breaking down the barriers towards defining real female beauty, they now seem to be  interested in defining female power -- in all of its various forms. \n\nBarbie pushed girls to dream big about their future professions, Target ripped the \"boys\" and \"girls\" labels off of its toy aisles and female athletes started getting more big endorsement deals. \n\nThat trend also came with more introspection from the ads industry on the scarcity of women among its own creatives and executive ranks. The Cannes Lions Creativity festival launched a new female empowerment award sponsored by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to serve both of these ends in the hopes that more female voices would lead to even more empowering ads.\n\n\"We know that the messages that our industry puts out have a tremendous impact on culture,\" the festival's director of brand strategy, Senta Slingerland, told Mashable in an earlier interview. \"So celebrating work that is trying to represent gender in a more realistic and progressive way can also have a real impact on culture.\"\n\n3. Gender identity\n\nWhile advertisers have made strides towards better connecting with gay and lesbian people, the American transgender experience has always remained something of a blindspot.\n\nBut now that pop culture is embracing a wider definition of gender identity more than ever -- with stars like Laverne Cox, TV shows like Amazon's Transparent and the generally positive reception to Caitlyn Jenner's monumental transformation -- a few bolder brands started to venture into the conversation this year.\n\nOne was Google, which showcased the real-life journey of a transgender man in a moving two-and-a-half minute video that aired during the broadcast of Jenner's speech at ESPN's Espy awards. The ad avoids any opportunistic airs by tying the theme to the product. \n\n \n\nOther major campaigns to embrace gender identity this year included Magnum Ice cream's slick \"Be True to Yourself\" spot and a British ad for Pot Noodle.  \n\nMISSES:\n\nAdvertisers are of course not the entities we look to for the cutting edge of progressivism. Most of the examples above, laudable as they are, are capitalizing on changing social mores rather than pushing them -- and that's all we really expect. \n\nStill, there are always times when corporations could have shown more responsibility or better captured contemporary public attitudes in the messages they broadcasted. \n\nSex still sells\n\nDespite strides forward in the way women are portrayed in advertising, brands like Carl's Jr. continue to unapologetically objectify women in their campaigns -- with the notable exception of Ronda Rousey's commercial. \n\nWhile these ads are now much fewer and more far between, these attitudes will still persist so long as \"young hungry men\" are willing to buy into them, as the chief marketing officer of Carls Jr. parent, Yum Brands, has put it.   \n\nPretending Coke is healthy\n\nAs other advertisers latched onto social causes, Coca-Cola resorted to the uglier side of \"cause\"-based tactics most famously employed by Big Tobacco and oil companies.\n\nIn the face of growing outcry over the sugary beverage's links to health problems like Type 2 diabetes and obesity, the soda giant enlisted influential scientists to spread the message that Americans should worry less about watching their calories and more about exercising regularly.  \n\nA viral public service announcement from the Center for Science in Public Interest poked some holes in this logic, while cleverly hijacking Coke's custom name generator.\n\nThe Caitlyn Jenner moment\n\nBrands largely ducked out of what was seen as a watershed cultural moment when Caitlyn Jenner unveiled her gender transformation on the cover of Vanity Fair. \n\nGranted, Jenner isn't the perfect heroine, and her connection with the downmarket headline-crashing Kardashian clan brand might not suit every company. But advertisers could have made a powerful statement by backing and celebrating a high-profile landmark for the transgender community in the same way they do with other stars who captivate the public.   \n\nInstead, most brands remained largely absent from the ensuing conversation for weeks -- besides the few mentioned above -- and when Jenner made a speech at the ESPN's Espy awards, the channel reportedly had hard time selling the slots on either side of it.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

If you intend to see\u00a0Star Wars: The Force Awakens but haven't yet, don't read any further.\n\nSee also: Disgruntled 'Star Wars' fans threaten 'spoiler jihad': Why they need to just chill out\n\nYou've been warned.\n\nNow that the riff-raff is gone, there are likely\u00a0two types of people still reading. You've either seen\u00a0The Force Awakens already, or you're skipping it because it erases the Expanded Universe -- but you're still curious to know what, if any, aspects of that material can be found in the new movie. In case you're a member of the first group, this might be helpful:\r\nWhat is the Expanded Universe?\r\nThe\u00a0Star Wars Expanded Universe (or EU) as most know it kicked off in 1991 with the release of Timothy Zahn's\u00a0Heir to the Empire.\u00a0That novel was the first official\u00a0Star Wars story to take place after the events of\u00a0Return of the Jedi, which had been released eight years earlier.\n\nLots of books (and comics and video games) followed. Together, they established an elaborate post-Jedi\u00a0(and pre-New Hope) chronology, with major character introductions, galaxy-spanning arcs and significant births/deaths.\n\nThen Disney purchased the Lucas empire in 2012 and began working on a new, post-Jedi trilogy of films. Fans of the EU didn't know what to expect -- how would this new trilogy affect the stories we knew?\n\nWe found out in Apr. 2014. It was not good news: The EU was done. It would forevermore be known as\u00a0Star Wars Legends, with almost 25 years worth of\u00a0lore being shoved aside in favor of a new series canon contained within the films, the two TV series (Clone Wars and\u00a0Rebels) and a growing selection\u00a0of newer books, comics and video games.\n\nNow\u00a0The Force Awakens is finally here, and it's got an all new take on the post-Jedi landscape of\u00a0Star Wars. The EU is technically dead, but eagle-eyed fans can see where J.J. Abrams was taking notes from it. Read on for a rundown of EU echoes and inspirations that may have informed this new era of\u00a0Star Wars entertainment.\r\nLuke Skywalker tried to rebuild the Jedi Order\r\nWhile the details aren't clear,\u00a0The Force Awakens\u00a0shares the revelation that Luke Skywalker tried to rebuild the Jedi Order in the aftermath of Emperor Palpatine's defeat at Endor. His efforts came undone when one student -- Kylo Ren -- turned against his master, bringing an end to the nascent Jedi Order 2.0 and scaring Luke into a life of seclusion.\n\nThe EU Luke also rebuilt the Jedi Order, in a trilogy of Jedi Academy books. His so-called \"New Jedi Order\" never fell apart, but Luke was no stranger to student betrayals as he worked to bring a\u00a0Jedi presence back into\u00a0the galaxy.\n\nThere was even a period in which Luke was sent into exile for failing to prevent Han and Leia Solo's son from turning to the Dark Side and nearly toppling the New Republic. Which leads us to....\r\nBen \"Kylo Ren\"\u00a0Solo-Organa\r\nThis one's a bit of a mish-mash, but there are echoes of several EU plot threads\u00a0in the Kylo Ren character.\n\nThe Force Awakens\u00a0begins with Han and Leia estranged -- but we know they got busy and made a kid at some point in the past. Ben Solo-Organa (we're assuming a progressive hyphenate for this couple) picked up his mother's Force sensitivity and trained under Luke, eventually turning against his uncle under the influence of Supreme Leader Snoke.\n\nHan and Leia enjoyed a much happier post-Jedi relationship in the EU. Their courtship and eventual marriage led to three children: twins Jacen and Jaina, and their youngest, Anakin.\n\nIt's Jacen who turned to the Dark Side, following the same path that Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious did as he assumed command of the New Republic while secretly operating as a Sith. Jacen was eventually killed by his sister\u00a0-- a possible parallel with Rey, whose parentage remains unknown --\u00a0a Skywalker-trained Jedi.\n\nThe name \"Ben\" is actually given to Luke's son in the EU. In the years following\u00a0Jedi, Luke sparred with and eventually fell for Mara Jade, a Force-sensitive former agent of Palpatine. The EU Ben was tempted by Jacen's influence for a time, but he ultimately resisted the lure of the Dark Side.\r\nWhat is Rey's heritage?\r\nIt's unclear who Rey's parents are, but\u00a0The Force Awakens\u00a0raises the distinct possibility that she's a Skywalker. It's not just the Force sensitivity: Rey experiences a powerful vision when she touches Luke's old lightsaber at Maz Kanata's hideaway. She also appears at the Resistance base just as R2-D2 finally wakes up and helps complete the map to Luke's hideaway.\n\nA father-daughter connection between Rey and Luke is almost\u00a0too telegraphed in The Force Awakens\u00a0to be real. This could easily be a red herring meant to keep fans guessing in the run-up to\u00a0Episode VIII. But the evidence is hard to ignore.\n\nIf Rey\u00a0is a Skywalker, her duel with Kylo becomes a family affair. It's not quite the same as the twin vs. twin showdown between Jacen and Jaina in the EU timeline, but both scenarios are very much in keeping with the spirit of the series.\n\nDeath Star 2.0\r\nThe Force Awakens introduces Starkiller Base, a planet that appears to have been repurposed as a potent superweapon. Its main gun absorbs the power of a nearby star, then fires it in a massive burst that is capable of wiping out entire star systems.\n\nIt's similar to the Sun Crusher, an EU superweapon that also has the ability to wipe out whole systems. But where Starkiller Base is a planet-sized weapon that projects a sun's energy outwards, the Sun Crusher's impermeable armor allows it to get close enough to launch its special torpedoes into a star's core, triggering a supernova.\r\nIs Supreme Leader Snoke a familiar Darth?\r\nThe Force Awakens introduces Supreme Leader Snoke, overlord of the Empire-aping First Order, as a towering hologram. He's only in a few scenes, and we never get a great look at him -- but Snoke bears more than a passing resemblance to the Muun, one of the alien races introduced in the Prequel Trilogy.\n\nThe prequels also made mention of Darth Plagueis, the Muun Sith Lord who trained Emperor Palpatine in the ways of the Dark Side. There's a whole EU book about their relationship, and while those details are now the stuff of\u00a0Legends, Palpatine's description of Plagueis from\u00a0Revenge of the Sith\u00a0remains part of the official canon.\n\n\"Darth Plagueis the Wise,\" Palpatine says. Snoke is referred to as \"wise\" more than once in\u00a0The Force Awakens. Is this a sly reference? Hard to say. But with Plagueis having been established both in the canon and the EU, it's certainly plausible to speculate that he staged his death and went into hiding until Palpatine fell.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

They love them so much that a lot of the human resources industry is geared toward hiring them. \n\nLess attention is paid to making sure companies don't hire toxic employees. A working paper from Harvard's business school argues that shouldn't be the case.\n\nSee also: 6 ways to help you stop micromanaging your employees\n\nEntitled \"Toxic Workers,\" the paper found that employees that hurt the company do enough harm to outweigh the positive effects of star employees -- even when those star employees are the ones who happen to be toxic. Specifically, the authors state that \"we find that avoiding toxic workers is still better for the firm in terms of net profitability, despite losing out on a highly productive worker.\"\n\nAvoiding toxic workers might seem like a no-brainer, but there's a catch -- they're often among the most productive workers. That's not a terribly new idea (plenty of studies have validated that hypothesis), but the notion that star employees can be more trouble than they're worth is. \n\nThe motivation to hire star employees is particularly great in the tech world, where companies are competing for high-end talent that can build innovative products. So-called \"10X\" employees -- termed that because they are 10 times as productive as average employees -- are in particularly high demand, and compensated accordingly. Mark Zuckerberg once said the engineers of a company that Facebook acquired were 100 times better than the average coder -- which is why Facebook paid $47 million for it despite only having 12 full-time employees. \n\nThe authors looked at data from more than 50,000 workers at 11 companies, measuring a range of actions of toxic workers from small offenses like stealing office supplies to far more severe acts like falsifying documents or sexual harassment. \n\n\"Since we found some evidence that a toxic worker can have more impact on performance than a 'superstar,' it may be that spending more time limiting negative impacts on an organization might improve everyone's outcome to a greater extent than only focusing on increasing positive impacts,\" the paper states.\n\nThat's not to say good employees aren't valuable, but the benefits of avoiding toxic ones, according to the authors, easily outweigh the loss of missing out on star workers. Housman and Minor write that doing so generates \"returns of nearly two-to-one\" for companies. \n\n\"This suggests more broadly that 'bad' workers may have a stronger effect on the firm than 'good' workers,\" the paper states. \"In many other fields and disciplines researchers have found that a negative has a stronger impact than a positive.\""},"shares":{"twitter":892,"facebook":224,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":28,"pinterest":1,"total":1153},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2MyL1R3aXR0ZXJfRW1wLjljODNmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/a5d8068c/155/Twitter_Employees1.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2MyL1R3aXR0ZXJfRW1wLjljODNmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/69145060/155/Twitter_Employees1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2MyL1R3aXR0ZXJfRW1wLjljODNmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1NngyMDUjCmUJanBn/6acff46b/155/Twitter_Employees1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2MyL1R3aXR0ZXJfRW1wLjljODNmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTcxMng0MTAjCmUJanBn/a7d143eb/155/Twitter_Employees1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2MyL1R3aXR0ZXJfRW1wLjljODNmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTI4MHgxNTcjCmUJanBn/e3c61af6/155/Twitter_Employees1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzEyLzIwL2MyL1R3aXR0ZXJfRW1wLjljODNmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTU2MHgzMTQjCmUJanBn/6f726646/155/Twitter_Employees1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1YpNFG1","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/08/25/micromanaging-employees/#4zmTtKCFvmqM"}]},"velocity":[948,957,965,972,978,983,987,990,981,982,987,991,994,996,998,999,1000,999,998,997,994,991,989,987,984,980,976,972,956,951,935,930,924,919,914,908,891,887,881,875,867,859,851,844,837,829,821,813,804,795],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/"},{"_id":"56761310b589e45eb00012e2","id":"2015/12/19/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-apology","title":"Bernie Sanders apologizes to Hillary Clinton in the most Bernie Sanders way","title_tag":null,"author":"Emily Cahn","post_date":"2015-12-20T02:31:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 02:31:07 +0000","sort_key":"1AaKLX","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/12/19/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-apology/","content":{"plain":"Sen.

It\u2019s fully documented in the system logs.

The suspension led to a federal lawsuit Friday, which was promptly resolved giving back the Sanders campaign access to the files.\n\nClinton's campaign accused Sanders' campaign of theft over the issue, while Sanders' campaign sought to turn a war against the DNC into a winning one for his. In fact, Sanders' campaign says it raised \"seven figures\" over the issue, according to POLITICO.\n\nI'm told by a campaign aide that Bernie Sanders brought in \"seven figures\" yesterday while news was developing of his war with the DNC\u2014 Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) December 19, 2015\n\nSee also: Bernie Sanders campaign files lawsuit against Democratic National Committee\n\nBut Sanders did not back off his attacks on the DNC for the suspension at the debate.\n\n\"What I have a real problem with, and I recognize this is a problem, but what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to information, crippling our campaign,\" Sanders said.\n\nBadly lagging in the polls and seeking to gain traction, former Maryland Gov.

Pillow talk\n\nIf you're too tired to stay up until midnight, or your partner's time zone is quite different than yours, try using Pillow Talk. This device, which is currently featured on Kickstarter, allows you to feel your significant other's heartbeat on your pillow. How? You each wear a wristband that sends your heartbeat via a smartphone app to the other person's pillow. The small speaker under the pillow will allow couples to fall asleep hearing each other's heartbeats. One will cost $99 and a pair will cost $179. \n\nFounder and CEO Joanna Montgomery tells Mashable that Pillow Talk hopes to \"achieve a sense of connection that doesn't require sitting in front of a screen.\"\n\n2. Hug Shirt\n\n  A video posted by CuteCircuit (@cutecircuit) on Jun 12, 2015 at 9:56am PDT\n\nJust because you can't kiss at midnight doesn't mean you can't hug your significant other. Cutecircuit created Hug Shirt -- wearable tech that allows you to hug someone anywhere in the world. The shirt uses sensors, Bluetooth and an app to transmit your hug to your partner miles away. The shirt costs more than $300 and can be found on Cutecircuit's website. The newest Hug Shirt will be available at the beginning of 2016.\n\n3. Couple\n\nUse your thumb to kiss your loved one on NYE with the help of Couple. This app -- previously known as Pair -- vibrates the phone when each person has touched their thumb to the same spot. In addition to the ThumbKiss, Couple allows users to share moments together privately on the Timeline, and couples can chat on the app as well. \n\nThe app is free for iPhone and Android.\n\n4.

Kissenger -- aptly named because of its function as a kiss messenger -- uses motion sensors to send your smooches to your significant other far away.\n\n\"The Kissenger brings a new dimension to long distance communications by allowing the sharing of a kiss, the most basic yet emotional interaction between two individuals,\" Kissengers' co-founder and CEO Dinos Andreou tells Mashable. \"It increases the level of interaction over the net, hence making the sorrow of the distance more bearable.\"\n\nLong-distance couples can contact Kissenger for a pre-order of the device, but it won't be available until January 2016.

But, some breweries use animal products like gelatin and isinglass -- a substance made from fish bladders -- in their filtration process, thus making their product non-vegan. \n\nWith Guinness' move towards becoming a vegan-friendly stout, we decided to delve into the world of vegan beer to find the very best on the market.\n\nNote: We used Barnivore, the vegan guide to all things alcohol-related, to verify that the products were truly vegan. \n\nSee also: How to cook a vegan Wendy's Baconator (sorry in advance)\n\n1. Ninkasi\n\n  A photo posted by @ninkasibrewing on Aug 7, 2014 at 3:35pm PDT\n\nNinkasi beer is a flavorful, yet balanced beer. For a Ninkasi beginner, their Total Domination IPA is highly recommended -- with a citrusy, floral smell and a bold hop flavor, this is the most popular brew the company has to offer.\n\nNinkasi founding brewer Jamie Floyd tells Mashable that he chose to create vegan beers in order to retain the flavor and aroma of his brew. He does this by eliminating filters from his brewing process, instead opting for a high velocity centrifuge. \n\nWhile almost all of Ninkasi's beers are vegan, they did release a coffee milk stout that contains milk fat. It is the only Ninkasi product that is not considered vegan. \n\n2. Flying Dog Brewery\n\nBloodline Blood Orange Ale smells and tastes like a fresh grapefruit. The citrusy sweetness is balanced nicely by the ale's bitterness to create a refreshing, yet flavorful IPA. Medium-bodied, the blood orange ale has a crisp finish with a pleasing -- albeit long lasting -- aftertaste.  \n\nFlying Dog Pearl Necklace, Secret Stash and Table for Two are three of the only non-vegan-friendly brews from the company. You can check whether a beer is vegan friendly on the site prior to purchase.\n\n3. Pilsner Urquell\n\n  A photo posted by kathy (@kathykaykay) on Dec 7, 2015 at 2:29am PST\n\nArguably one of the most famous pilsners on the market, this earthy beer is hearty in all senses of the word. With hints of honeysuckle and a suspiciously close taste to bread, it's hard to resist this Bohemian brew. \n\n4. Stella Artois\n\n  A photo posted by Stella Artois (@stellaartois) on Apr 13, 2015 at 2:07pm PDT\n\nA Belgian brew, Stella Artois was originally brewed for the holidays. But, the beer's light body and crisp, clean finish made it an everyday staple in Europe, Australia and now North America. Stella is perfect for those beer drinkers who are afraid to try a bold brew.  \n\n5. Revoultion Brewing\n\nThis Belgian-style ale adds a modern twist to the classic pilsner. The wheat beer is lightly spiced with fresh ground coriander and zest from an orange peel. With 5.0% ABV, this beer has a silky smooth finish -- surprising for such a strongly flavored beer. Nevertheless, this golden ale never fails to make beer drinking taste delicious.\n\nRevolution brewing's Mad Cow Milk Stout is the only company beer that is not considered vegan.  \n\n6. Ballast Point\n\n  A photo posted by Jonesy's Liquor (@jonesysliquor) on Oct 22, 2015 at 10:17am PDT\n\nIf you're looking for a medium-bodied stout, try The Commodore from Ballast Point. Notes of coffee and chocolate can be tasted, but don't overwhelm the flavor of the beer. The light citrus addition provides a light, airy aroma to the stout. \n\n7. Back Forty Beer Company\n\nBack Forty is known for their Southern inspired brews. One of their most popular brews, Naked Pig, is a light pale ale that features 6% alcohol in each bottle. German malts combined with several different hops make this a crisp, flavorful drink for vegan (and craft-beer) newcomers. \n\nThe one beer that is not considered vegan friendly from Back Forty is their Truck Stop Honey.\n\n8. Harpoon Brewery\n\n  A photo posted by Harpoon Brewery (@harpoonbrewery) on Nov 10, 2015 at 5:05pm PST\n\nAside from their Oyster Stout, all Harpoon Brewery beers are considered vegan friendly. Try their UFO White, a spice-filled wheat beer that maintains a balanced citrusy flavor. \n\nAlternatively, the UFO Pumpkin brew is one of the best pumpkin ales on the market. This seasonal beer has a distinctive flavor that comes the closest to drinking pumpkin pie since a PSL. \n\n9. Terrapin\n\n  A photo posted by Prolific Pints (@prolificpints) on Dec 1, 2015 at 9:48pm PST\n\nTerrapin's original Rye Pale Ale is available year round -- unlike some of their other popular flavors. According to their website, Terrapin's Rye brew acquires its signature taste by using an exact amount of rye -- a grain not often found in micro-brewed beers. The pale ale features five varieties of hops and several specialty malts to create a bold flavor that overwhelms the senses. \n\nTerrapin beers that are not considered vegan friendly include Gamma Ray, Moo-Hoo and Sun Ray.\n\n10. Trader Joe's brand beer\n\nThat's right, TJ's stocks several brand-name vegan beers on their shelves -- including their popular European lagers and pale ales. If you're in a rush, or just want to purchase cheap, but delicious beer, just know that TJ's has you covered. \n\nRecommended: Mission Street Pale Ale and Josephsbrau Bavarian Style Hefeweizen.\n\nBONUS: Corona, Budweiser, Sam Adams and Pabst Blue Ribbon all feature vegan beers. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

The launch will be live streamed, but we'll have to wait to see footage of the landing.\n\nSee also: SpaceX will try to land a rocket stage on Earth after launching to space Sunday\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk teased the launch on Saturday.\n\nCurrently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 19, 2015\n\nRockets are rarely reusable. Most times they blast something into space and then fall into the ocean. That makes them very expensive, since these incredibly complex machines are only used once. \n\nSpaceX and Blue Origin, which is backed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, have both been working on making rockets that can be recovered after launch. Bezos and Musk have actually been in something of a rocket-measuring contest over it. \n\nIn November, Blue Origin successfully launched a rocket into space and then recovered it. The rocket, called New Shepard, took a payload a bit more than 100 kilometers from earth and then returned for a nice, soft landing. It was a major achievement, but one that Musk is hoping to best on Sunday. \n\nShepard made a suborbital trip, meaning the spacecraft never quite achieved the speed or height necessary to qualify for a truly orbital trip. The SpaceX launch is projected to go into orbit, which would one-up Bezos and Blue Origin and be the first orbital rocket to be recovered. \n\nThis is a tough business. In June, SpaceX tried a similar feat, only to have its Falcon 9 rocket explode over the coast of Florida. These trips are uncrewed, so nobody was hurt. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

In February, social workers and computer scientists came up with an algorithm to prevent the spread of HIV among homeless youth. In March, a research lab created a microchip that could actually help bridge the digital divide in developing countries.\n\nSee also: 7 incredibly simple inventions that are changing the world\n\nAnd the revolutionary ideas and inventions tackling the world's most pressing problems kept coming throughout the year.\n\nFrom a new sneaker that helps people with physical disabilities, to \"nanosheets\" that can absorb oil spills, to a bindi that delivers much-needed iodine to women in India, these are some of our favorite innovations that truly made a difference in 2015.\n\n1. The machine that converts poop into clean drinking water\n\nApproximately 2.4 billion people around the world didn't have access to basic, safe sanitation in 2015, while more than 660 million people used unimproved drinking water sources.\n\nThe Gates Foundation talked to engineers to figure out how we could use technology to tackle these issues. Peter Janicki, CEO of Janicki Bioenergy, developed a machine (shown in the video above) that converts sewer sludge into clean drinking water, electricity and pathogen-free ash in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe processor can help developing countries both by providing clean water and energy, as well as employing entrepreneurs to run it in the regions where it's needed most.\n\n2. The algorithm that can prevent HIV among homeless youth\n\nTo prevent the spread of HIV among the homeless, USC researchers turn to math: http://t.co/FdNH5LgDx4 pic.twitter.com/F8yKOJdcZZ\u2014 USC (@USC) February 4, 2015\n\nHomelessness affects about 2 million people between the ages of 13 and 24 every year in the United States -- 11% of whom are HIV-positive. But researchers at the University of Southern California's Schools of Social Work and Engineering developed a new algorithm called PSINET, which uses artificial intelligence to identify the best person in a specific homeless community to spread important information about HIV prevention among youth.\n\nComputer scientists mapped the friendships of homeless teens at a local homeless agency in Los Angeles. The algorithm looks at this network of friendships, and runs through thousands of possibilities for the person with the greatest reach at a certain point in time. That \"peer leader\" can then learn about basic information, like where to get tested for HIV, and in turn provide researchers with more information about the homeless community.\n\nAccording to the researchers, PSINET spread 60% more information to communities than typical word-of-mouth campaigns.\n\n3. The sneaker technology designed for people with disabilities\n\nIn 2012, Matthew Walzer, who has cerebral palsy, wrote a letter to Nike asking the company to create sneakers that people with disabilities could easily put on and take off without the help of others. This year, the company announced a new line of footwear -- Flyease -- that has a zipper extending around the back of the shoe.\n\nInstead of laces, which are incredibly difficult for people with movement disorders, stroke victims and amputees, the zipper allows you to \"peel\" it open with one hand and slide your foot in easily.\n\nNike's senior director of athlete innovation, Tobie Hatfield, designed the technology and worked with Walzer to develop and test the sneakers.\n\n4. The life-saving device that can seal a wound in under a minute\n\nOregon startup RevMedX's new device XSTAT 30 is a syringe filled with tiny, biocompatible sponges, which can be injected into a deep wound to absorb blood and seal it in less than a minute. While it's been used on the battlefield since April 2014, it was recently approved by the FDA for civilian use.\n\nA RevMedx researcher told PBS NewsHour that the sponges expand up to 15 times their size when they make contact with blood, which allows them to apply internal pressure to the walls of the wound cavity and block blood flow. The sponges would replace a medic's traditional method of deeply packing a wound with gauze and maintaining pressure.\n\n5. The \"Internet on a microchip\"\n\nThe WiderNet Project, based at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, developed the eGranary Pocket Library -- a microchip that taps into the power of smartphones, laptops and tablets to deliver offline information and educational resources to billions of people without access to the Internet.\n\nWiderNet has connected with with ministries of education, ministries of health and schools of information science in various countries, and aims to fill each \"library on a chip\" with a few thousand documents that a given institution, such as a medical school in Zambia, identifies as its core material.\n\nThe project reached its crowdfunding goal in May, and is collaborating with librarians, educators and volunteers around the world to pinpoint the information needed most.\n\n6. Dinnerware that makes life easier for dementia sufferers\n\nThe cognitive and sensory impairments associated with dementia often result in difficulty eating -- spills, confusion by intricate patterns on dinnerware and more -- and out of frustration, sufferers often eat less than they should.\n\nTo tackle this issue, industrial designer Sha Yao created Eatwell, an eight-piece dining set that uses more than 20 distinct features to give dementia sufferers more independence during mealtime. For example, the dishware has slanted bottoms for easy scooping, bright colors to distinguish food and especially ergonomic utensils.\n\n7. 3D-printed rotors that freeze seawater into drinking water\n\nGE has long been expert in steam turbine technology for the desalination of water, but in 2015 it began to miniaturize the process.\n\nA news release from the company explains:\n\n\"As part of the water desalination technology being developed with the [U.S. Department of Energy], researchers are using the same steam turbine turbomachinery 3D printed in a miniaturized form to compress and stream a mixture of air, salt and water through a hyper-cooling loop that freezes seawater. By freezing the mixture, the salt naturally separates in solid form, leaving just the ice. The ice is then melted, leaving clean water.\"\n\nThe design is a low-cost, low-energy way to create drinking water, and GE will continue to test the technology through mid-2016 to assess its feasibility.\n\n8. The lamps powered by plants\n\nApproximately 42% of rural areas in the Peruvian jungle don't have electricity, according to Peru's latest National Household Survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Information.\n\nThe Universidad de Ingenier\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda (UTEC), which is known for developing innovative technologies in response to pressing world issues, created the Plantal\u00e1mparas -- a lamp that runs on plant power and lights the small village of Nuevo Saposoa.\n\nDuring photosynthesis, the plant's waste decomposes in the soil, producing electrons during oxidation. The UTEC team captures these electrons by using electrodes in the soil and storing it in batteries. This process can light the LED bulbs for up to two hours.\n\n9. A revolutionary material that could absorb large oil spills\n\nResearchers at Deakin University in Australia, along with scientists at Drexel University in Philadelphia and Missouri University, developed a type of \"nanosheet\" that can clean up oil spills like a sponge. Each nanosheet is made up of flakes that are only several nanometers (one-billionth of a meter) thick with tiny holes, which can grow to the size of 5.5 tennis courts.\n\n\"The pores in the nanosheets provide the surface area to absorb oils and organic solvents up to 33 times its own weight,\" one of the researchers said.\n\nThe team developed an early-stage prototype of the idea in 2013, when it was a powder and didn't yet have a practical use. \n\n10. The laundry device that lets washers reuse water for months\n\nWashing machines use 20 gallons of water to remove one tablespoon of dirt. To conserve water and maintain efficiency, three graduate students at MIT invented AquaFresco, a type of filter that allows washing machines to reuse 95% of the water produced from each load.\n\nThe device filters out waste and recycles clean water and detergent for further cleaning cycles -- up to six months' worth.\n\n11. The durable, flat-pack housing for refugees\n\n520 @Better_Shelter units have recently been delivered to UNHCR operations in #Greece: http://t.co/kuIfscMwSC pic.twitter.com/dj1vb3AUuC\u2014 UNHCR Innovation (@UNHCRInnovation) October 8, 2015\n\nThe Better Shelter is a temporary shelter created with refugees in mind, and has an expected lifespan of three years. It comes in flat packs, which means aid organizations can transport it efficiently and assemble it without tools. The designer created the shelters with family needs in mind, so each one includes a solar panel and lamp to provide light.\n\nBetter Shelter teamed up with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the IKEA Foundation to use the shelters in the countries where refugees need them the most, such as Greece.\n\n12. A low-cost device that simplifies auto-transfusion\n\nIn some developing countries, when patients hemorrhage blood during childbirth, doctors use a ladle and cheesecloth to perform auto-transfusion -- gathering and recycling blood for the same patient during a medical procedure. This DIY method is necessary because the machinery and supplies typically used for transfusions are so costly. \n\nSisu Global Health's first device, the Hemafuse, is a low-cost product that makes the process simpler and more sanitary. It works like a hand-pump, sucking up blood and then passing it through a valve to a blood bag for later use. A filter removes clots and other particulates in the blood.\n\nThe Hemafuse won the 2015 Social Impact Prize at the SXSW Eco Awards in October and received a $100,000 investment from AOL cofounder Steve Case in September.\n\n13. This 15-year-old's energy probe powered by ocean waves\n\nHannah Herbst from Boca Raton, Florida, won the 2015 Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge with her energy probe prototype,  which seeks to \"offer a stable power source to developing countries by using untapped energy from ocean currents.\"\n\nThe probe uses a 3D-printed propeller connected to a hydroelectric generator via a pulley system. The generator turns the movement of ocean waves through the propeller into usable electricity -- a small amount that would be enough to power a desalination machine.\n\n14. The prosthetic hand that can generate a sense of touch\n\nMost prosthetics can't allow their wearers to regain their senses of touch, but DARPA's latest version of its prosthetic hand uses neurotechnology to do just that.\n\nResearchers wired a 28-year-old man's prosthetic -- a mechanical hand developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at Johns Hopkins University -- directly to his brain using electrodes on his sensory cortex and motor cortex. He became the first person to be able to \"feel\" physical sensations through a prosthetic hand, according to DARPA.\n\n15. A simple toolkit to help girls wash and dry reusable pads\n\nProduct designer Mariko Higaki Iwai and a team of art students created Flo, a simple kit that allow girls in developing countries to easily wash, dry and carry reusable sanitary pads. Flo aims to ensure that girls don't miss school or work due to the stigma of menstruation, don't contract reproductive infections and illnesses, and also maintain confidence. \n\nThe product is essentially an enclosed basket spun between strings to wash sanitary pads and reduce drying time. The basket inside turns into a drying rack, and the kit also includes a carrying case to carry both new and old pads discreetly.\n\n16. The student-made device helping babies breathe\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, acute respiratory illnesses are one of the leading causes of death among children under the age of five. Babies who have trouble breathing usually need Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), a simple process that in developing countries sometimes only requires a tube submerged in water. But babies in severe respiratory distress require Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV), a process that often calls for costly machinery.\n\nThe NeoVent, which was created by undergrad students at Western Michigan University, uses an inverted bowl mechanism that oscillates to provide two levels of pressure needed to help babies breathe.\n\nThe device allows any medical center in the developing world equipped to perform CPAP adapt its machinery to perform NIPPV.\n\n17. The eco-friendly brick that could revolutionize India\n\nIn India, there are hundreds of thousands of brick kilns producing close to 200 billion bricks per year -- and the process contributes considerably to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Paper mills also dump boiler ash in landfills, which affects both human and environmental health and has no practical use.\n\nTackling both issues head-on, students at MIT developed a new brick, called the Eco BLAC brick. The students made the brick from boiler ash using low-energy alkali activation technology rather than firing in a kiln.\n\nIn the end, the project recycles industrial waste into construction materials. The students are currently working in the city Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, where they're partnering with a paper mill owner to implement a pilot plant on-site.\n\n18. The printable strips for in-home testing of infectious diseases\n\nResearchers at Florida Atlantic University have created paper and plastic strips for in-home diagnostic testing of HIV, E.coli, Staphylococcus aureas and other bacteria, as well as a smartphone app that could detect these bacteria using images remotely.\n\nAccording to Fast Company, the E.coli test is made of paper (cellulose) and printed with a mixture of antibodies and gold nanoparticles. If bacteria is found, a color change indicates a positive result.\n\nThe plastic HIV test will begin trials at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and the researchers hope to commercialize the tests by mid-2016.\n\n19. The bindi delivering much-needed iodine to impoverished women in India\n\nWomen in India traditionally wear a bindi -- a small dot between the eyebrows -- for religious purposes or to show they're married, but it's grown in popularity among all women. \n\nTalwar Bindi's Life Saving Dot has an even higher purpose: vital health.\n\nThe Live Saving Dot is coated with iodine and delivers the recommended amount of 150-220 micrograms of the nutrient daily to poor women in India, where approximately 350 million people are at risk for iodine deficiency. A lack iodine can cause a number of health problems, especially during a woman's pregnancy.\n\nIodine can be absorbed through the skin, and the Life Saving Dot would be a particularly low-cost nutritional supplement -- it costs only 10 rupees, or 16 cents, for a packet of 30 bindis. It has been distributed to women across rural India through health camps and clinics in several villages.\n\n20. The beehive that harvests honey on its own\n\nTwo Aussie inventors created the Flow Hive beehive, which allows beekeepers to get honey on tap without opening the beehive and disturbing the bees.\n\nThe innovative hive's frames consist of partially formed honeycomb cells, which lets the bees complete the comb with their wax before filling the cells with honey. Beekeepers then need only turn a handle to split the cells vertically, so the honey can drip down to the base of the frame and out of the hive.\n\nThe Flow Hive has a clear window so you can watch the bees, which the inventors say can help with scientific research without disturbing them.\n\n21. A smartphone dongle for 15-minute diagnostic tests\n\nA team of researchers at Columbia University's School of Engineering has developed a low-cost smartphone dongle that can detect sexually transmitted infections from a finger prick of blood within 15 minutes.\n\nHealth care workers in Rwanda used the dongle in a pilot program by testing blood from 96 patients enrolled at prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission clinics or voluntary counseling and testing centers. They only needed 30 minutes of training. Users just have to place the blood in the plastic collector, insert it into the microfluidic cassette, open the accompanying app, insert the cassette into the dongle and press the bulb to initiate flow. After 15 minutes, results are shown on the smartphone.\n\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, the device costs $34.\n\n22. This advanced treatment for jaundice in newborns\n\nJaundice is the primary reason why newborns are readmitted to hospitals worldwide, and millions are not receiving effective treatment.\n\nAward-winning medical device nonprofit D-Rev launched its latest newborn product this year -- Brilliance Pro, an advanced version of its Brilliance Classic product from 2012, which treats newborn jaundice with sophisticated phototherapy.\n\nBrilliance Pro uses an integrated light meter, has expanded functionality and is sleeker to work better in the NICU. It retails at $400, and the distributor is Phoenix Medical Systems in India.\n\n23. The best knee joint prosthetic for developing world amputees\n\nIn addition to newborn health, D-Rev also works on mobility. This year it launched the latest version of the ReMotion Knee, a high-performance prosthetic knee joint designed for people in the developing world.\n\nThe ReMotion Knee works with standard prosthetic leg systems and withstands humid and wet climates, and it's affordable at $80. So far, D-Rev has fit 7,351 amputees with the ReMotion Knee.\n\n24. A temporary tattoo that helps diabetics track blood sugar\n\nPatients with diabetes currently need to check their blood sugar multiple times per day with a painful finger prick. But nanoengineers at UC San Diego developed a temporary tattoo that non-invasively extracts and measures glucose levels in the fluid between skin cells.\n\nThe tattoo doesn't yet provide the necessary numerical levels, but the engineers say it will eventually have Bluetooth capabilities to garner such readouts. The method could pave the way for more uses of the technology, such as delivering medicines through the skin.\n\n25. The ocean acidification sensor that revitalizes conservation\n\nThe Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE aimed to improve our understanding of how carbon dioxide emissions affect ocean acidification, which affects sea life and disrupts the food chain.\n\nThe winner of the competition, Sunburst Sensors, developed a breakthrough sensor that can withstand long-term monitoring of pCO2 and pH, and could prove instrumental in understanding ocean acidification and saving the oceans.\n\n26.

Traditionally, rocket stages re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, burning up harmlessly after bringing a payload to orbit, but Musk hopes to bring these boosters back to the planet unharmed to be used again. \n\nSunday's test comes on the heels of a reusable rocket test successfully performed by another billionaire-backed rocket company. \n\nJeff Bezos' spaceflight company Blue Origin recently landed its suborbital rocket on a pad in Texas after launching on a test flight. \n\nSpaceX conducted a test-firing of the upgraded Falcon 9 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, on Friday, and while it took a few attempts, the company did manage to get it done in time to set the launch for Sunday at 8:29 p.m. ET.\n\nThe company will webcast the launch -- which is expected to bring 11 communications satellites to space for ORBCOMM -- starting at 8:00 p.m. ET on SpaceX's website Sunday. \n\nThe launch will be SpaceX's first since June, when an earlier version of the Falcon 9 exploded minutes after launching from Florida on an uncrewed mission to deliver supplies to the International Space Station.\n\nHave something to add to this story?
